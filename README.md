## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing **suspicious web traffic and potential cyber attacks** using real-world CloudWatch log data.

Built during my role as a **Data Analytics Intern**, this project demonstrates how **data analytics can directly support cybersecurity operations** by identifying abnormal behavior, attack patterns, and high-risk traffic sources.

> **Core idea:** Turn raw web logs into actionable security intelligence.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters
Web applications are constantly targeted by malicious actors.  
However, raw logs alone are noisy and meaningless without structured analysis.

This project shows how:
- SQL can be used for **threat detection**
- Dashboards can support **security monitoring**
- Data analytics bridges the gap between **logs and decisions**

This is where analytics meets cybersecurity — practically.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges such as:
- SQL Injection attempts  
- Brute-force login attacks  
- Suspicious IP activity  
- Sudden traffic spikes  

The challenge is not data availability, but **insight extraction**.

This project addresses that gap.
